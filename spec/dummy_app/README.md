cd the_sortable_tree/spec/dummy_app/

# cp config/database.yml.example config/database.yml

rake db:bootstrap RAILS_ENV=test
rspec
```


### Using ancestry

The dummy app supports a number ways to add a sortable tree to the model, which can be
set by the environment variable `SORTABLE_TREE_TYPE`.

* `awesome_nested_set` uses [awesome\_nested\_set](https://github.com/collectiveidea/awesome_nested_set),
* `ancestry`: with [ancestry](https://github.com/stefankroes/ancestry), and
* `ancestry_acts_as_list`: with both ancestry and [acts_as_list](https://github.com/swanandp/acts_as_list).

Note that you need to set the environment variable when seeding the database as well as when
running the rails server or tests.
